# horiseon-code-refactor
Homework 1

## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Things I worked on
* updated head and title description to "Horiseon Homepage" to be better suited for the actual description.

* updated the body portion of the html file

* replaced all div elements with semantic html elements including aside, figure, footer, header, main, nav and section.

* updated CSS file and removed div elements and replaced with corresponding semantic elements in html file.

* added alt descrtiptions to images and icons used on the file.
